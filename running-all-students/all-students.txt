How to run for a full list of students.

Step 1 - Decide where you are running. On a lab machine,
on a VM (see optional section below),
or just on your own machine.

If you want a machine to run tests on, use 'falcon02'.

Step 2 - Download all students from MMS.

Step 3 - extract the student zip. I would recommend using the program 'dtrx', and writing:

dtrx -rn FileFromMMS.zip

As this will deal with students who submitted tar or gzip files.

Step 4 - run:

./all-students.sh <directory of tests> <directory containing students> <output dir>

Example
=======

# First we'll get, and setup, the VM
# You should be able to cut+paste all these lines
hg clone https://sysc-public.hg.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/vagrant-f24
cd vagrant-f24
vagrant up

# Now we will put the files into it (change directory names as approraite

mkdir submissions
scp -r staffres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk:/staffres/CS1002/Practicals/Practical1-Tests submissions
cp -r staffres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk:/staffres/0-General/stacscheck stacscheckcpy


Assume we have downloaded CS1002_Assignment1.zip from MMS
mv ~/Downloads/CS1002_Assignment.zip submissions

- Now enter the VM

vagrant ssh

- Now go and run the tests

cd /vagrant/submissions
dtrx -rn CS1002_Assignment.zip
/vagrant/stacscheckcpy/running-all-students/all-students.sh Practical1-Tests CS1002_Assignment outputdir






Optional - Installing a lab-like virtual machine on your own laptop
===================================================================

Follow the instructions at:

https://sysc.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/vagrant/

Any files you put into the 'vagrant' subdirectory of this repository will appear, readable and writable, in
the '/vagrant' directory of the virtual machine.
