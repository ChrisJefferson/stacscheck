How to run for a full list of students. First a quick overview, then a line-by-line example

Step 1 - Decide where you are running. On a lab machine,
on a VM (see optional section below),
or just on your own machine.

If you want a machine to run tests on, use 'falcon02'.

Step 2 - Download all students from MMS.

Step 3 - Run './generate-report <directory of tests> -z <zip downloaded from MMS> -j4'

(The -j4 runs 4 students in parallel)

This will create a directory of output in a directory called 'output'.

Look at the overview created in index.html. If you want to re-run single students, do:

'./generate-report <directory of tests> <student1dir> <student2dir> ...'

Example
=======

# We should only have to these first steps once
# First we'll get, and setup, the VM
# You should be able to cut+paste all these lines
hg clone https://sysc-public.hg.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/vagrant-f24
cd vagrant-f24
vagrant up

# Now copy stacscheck into this directory from staffres

scp -r staffres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk:/staffres/0-General/stacscheck stacscheckcpy

# Now things we have to do for each practical!

# Grab the files
scp -r staffres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk:/staffres/CS1002/Practicals/Practical1-Tests Practical1-Tests


# Downloaded CS1002_Assignment1.zip from MMS, copy it into vagrant directory
# Now enter the VM

vagrant ssh

# Now go and run the tests

cp /vagrant/CS1002_Assignment.zip .

# Uncompress the file
dtrx -rn CS1002_Assignment.zip

# Run the tests
/vagrant/stacscheckcpy/running-all-students/all-students.sh Practical1-Tests CS1002_Assignment outputdir

# Generate overview
/vagrant/stacscheckcpy/running-all-students/student-overview Practical1-Tests outputdir/*.json > outputdir/overview.html






Optional - Installing a lab-like virtual machine on your own laptop
===================================================================

Follow the instructions at:

https://sysc.host.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/vagrant/

Any files you put into the 'vagrant' subdirectory of this repository will appear, readable and writable, in
the '/vagrant' directory of the virtual machine.
