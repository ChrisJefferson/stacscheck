How to run for a full list of students. First a quick overview, then a line-by-line example

Step 1 - Decide where you are running. On a lab machine or just on your own machine.

Step 2 - Download all student submissions from MMS.

Step 3 - Run './generate-report -t <directory of tests> -z <zip downloaded from MMS> -j 4'
	Alternatively, unzip the student submissions and run './generate-report -t <directory of tests> -d <unzip submissions downloaded from MMS> -j 4'

(The -j 4 runs 4 students in parallel)

This will create a directory of output in a directory called 'output'.

Look at the overview created in overview.html. If you want to re-run single students, do:

'./generate-report -t <directory of tests> <student1dir> <student2dir> ...'

To get a list of all options just run './generate-report'


cgroups
=======

'cgroups' provides a way of running student's code in isolation. This is particularly
useful if a student's code can break, by running my processes or eating all the memory.

This only works on linux machines, where the user can run programs as root (sorry!)

First run 'create_cgroup_dir.sh', which will ask for your password. Then use
'generate-report' as normal, passing the '-c' option.
