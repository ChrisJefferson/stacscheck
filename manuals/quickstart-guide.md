Quick Introductory Guide to `stacscheck`
========================================



Running `stacscheck`
--------------------

Go into the directory of your practical submission and run:

`stacscheck (path to tests)`

For example:

`stacscheck /studres/CS1002/Practicals/PracticalW04-Tests`

Useful options for `stacscheck`:

*  `--help`      : See all options
*  `--html=FILE` : Output a nice HTML output to FILE
*  `--version`   : Print out version of checker
*  `--verbose`   : Output lots of information about how the testing is progressing (probably too much)

Understanding tests
-------------------

If you want to understand what is being tested, go into the tests directory. Each test is based
on a shell script (which is a series of commands which can be run)

A full specification on how to read the tests is available [here](specification.html).
