Quickstart / Manual
===================

Go into the directory of your practical submission and run:

stacscheck (path to practical)

For example:

stacscheck /studres/CS1002/Practicals/PracticalW04-Tests

Useful options for stacscheck:

*  `--help`      : See all options
*  `--html=FILE` : Output a nice HTML output to FILE
*  `--verbose`   : Output lots of information about how the testing is progressing (probably too much)

Understanding tests
-------------------

If you want to understand what is being tested, go into the practical directory, and look in the files there.

An explanation of how practicals are laid out is in the [specification](specification.html)
