Quickstart / Manual
===================

Go into the directory of your practical submission and run:

autocheck.py <path to practical tests>

For example:

autocheck.py /studres/CS1002/Practicals/PracticalW04-Tests

Useful options for autocheck:

  --help      : See all options
  --html=FILE : Output a nice HTML output to FILE
  --verbose   : Output lots of information about how the testing is progressing (probably too much)

Understanding tests
-------------------

If you want to understand what is being tested, go into the practical directory, and look in the files there.

A (compressed) explanation of how practicals are laid out is in the [specification](specification.html)
