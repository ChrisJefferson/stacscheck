<h1>Installing stacscheck</h1>
<p>Firstly, if you are on a lab machine, or host server, you don't need to install <code>stacscheck</code>, you should
just be able to run it with <code>stacscheck</code>. Also, always make sure your practical runs on a lab machine or host
server before submitting!</p>
<p>If you want to install it yourself, on your own machine, read on. Note that <code>stacscheck</code> is not supported on windows.</p>
<p>You can always get the latest version of <code>stacscheck</code> from
<a href="https://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Library/stacscheck/">https://studres.cs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Library/stacscheck/</a>.
You only need the script <code>stacscheck</code> from this location.</p>
<p>After you download it, you need to (as with any program you download on linux or mac) run the tester with python, or
mark <code>stacscheck</code> executable.</p>
<p>The easier route is to run with python. Just type <code>python ~/Downloads/stacscheck</code> (assuming you downloaded into <code>~/Downloads</code>).
This should run the tester, and now just type <code>python ~/Downloads/stacscheck</code> wherever you would previously just type <code>stacscheck</code>.</p>
<p>Or, to avoid having to type <code>python</code> all the time, we can mark the program as executable. Here is how to do that, assuming
again the program is in <code>~/Downloads</code>:</p>
<pre><code>chmod +x ~/Downloads/stacscheck
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can run it by typing <code>~/Downloads/stacscheck</code>. You can also move this into any directory you like.</p>
