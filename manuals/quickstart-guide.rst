Quickstart Guide
================

Assuming you have stacscheck installed, go into the directory of your practical submission and run:

``stacscheck <path to tests>``

The paths to tests may be given, or a set of files you have downloaded -- in which case points stacscheck to them.

``stacscheck /submissions/Course/Practicals/PracticalW04``

Some optional command line arguments that are useful to know:

* ``--help`` : See all options
* ``--html=FILE`` : Output a nice HTML output to FILE
* ``--version`` : Print out the version of `stacscheck`
* ``--verbose`` : Print out all of the commands `stacscheck` runs and their inputs 

If `stacscheck` is not installed, read on to find out about :ref:`Installing stacscheck <install>`
