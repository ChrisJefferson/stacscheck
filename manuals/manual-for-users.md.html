<h1>Quickstart / Manual</h1>
<p>Go into the directory of your practical submission and run:</p>
<p>autocheck.py <path to practical tests></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>autocheck.py /studres/CS1002/Practicals/PracticalW04-Tests</p>
<p>Useful options for autocheck:</p>
<p>--help      : See all options
--html=FILE : Output a nice HTML output to FILE
--verbose   : Output lots of information about how the testing is progressing (probably too much)</p>
<h2>Understanding tests</h2>
<p>If you want to understand what is being tested, go into the practical directory, and look in the files there.</p>
<p>A (compressed) explanation of how practicals are laid out is in the <a href="specification.html">specification</a></p>
