Testing CS2002 C2
- Looking for submission in a directory called 'submission': Cannot find it....
Going to try hard, and guess the current directory. I'm probably wrong.
* BUILD TEST - build : fail
--- submission output ---
DIR/tests/tarxz-file/testdir/build.sh: line 3: ./practical.sh: No such file or directory
---

0 out of 1 tests passed
Building is failing, skipping tests
