Testing CS1234 Practical 1
- Looking for submission in a directory called 'timeout-fail-test': Already in it!
* BUILD TEST - build : !! 2 second timeout reached
fail
--- ran script ---
sleep 8
--- submission output ---
... Terminating due to timeout
---

Exiting early due to failed DIR/tests/timeout-fail-test/testdir/build.sh

0 out of 1 tests passed
Building is failing, so some tests were skipped
