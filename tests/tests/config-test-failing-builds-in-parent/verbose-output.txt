Testing CS1234 Practical 1
- Looking for submission in a directory called 'config-test-failing-builds-in-parent': Already in it!
* BUILD TEST - parent5/build-A : pass
* BUILD TEST - parent5/parent4/build-B : fail
--- ran script ---
echo build-B
exit 1
--- submission output ---
build-B
---

Exiting early due to failed DIR/tests/config-test-failing-builds-in-parent/parent5/parent4/build-B.sh

1 out of 2 tests passed
Building is failing, so some tests were skipped
