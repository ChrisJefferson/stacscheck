Testing CS2002 Practical 1
- Looking for directory 'source': - Warning, there are multiple subdirectories called 'source'.
 - found /Users/caj/reps/stacscheck/tests/tests/config-test-2-src/a/source
 - found /Users/caj/reps/stacscheck/tests/tests/config-test-2-src/q/source
 - I'm going to guess '/Users/caj/reps/stacscheck/tests/tests/config-test-2-src/a/source'.
 - If that's wrong, go into the correct directory.
