Testing CS1234 Practical 1
- Looking for submission in a directory called 'source': - Warning, there are multiple subdirectories called 'source'.
 - found DIR/tests/config-test-2-src/a/source
 - found DIR/tests/config-test-2-src/q/source
 - I'm going to guess 'DIR/tests/config-test-2-src/a/source'.
 - If that's wrong, go into the correct directory.
