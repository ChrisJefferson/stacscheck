Testing CS1234 Practical 1
- Looking for submission in a directory called 'check-build': Already in it!
* BUILD TEST - build1 : pass
* BUILD TEST - build2 : fail
--- ran script ---
echo Build 2
exit 1
--- submission output ---
Build 2
---

Exiting early due to failed DIR/tests/check-build/testdir/build2.sh

1 out of 2 tests passed
Building is failing, skipping tests
