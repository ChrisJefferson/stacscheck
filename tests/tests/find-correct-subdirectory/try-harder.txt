Testing CS1234 Practical 1
- Looking for submission in a directory called 'src': - Warning, there are multiple subdirectories called 'src'.
 - found DIR/tests/find-correct-subdirectory/CS1234 Practical1 Ext/src
 - found DIR/tests/find-correct-subdirectory/CS1234 Practical1/src
 - I'm going to guess 'DIR/tests/find-correct-subdirectory/CS1234 Practical1/src'.
 - If that's wrong, go into the correct directory.
* COMPARISON TEST - test_correct_output/prog-test.out : pass
